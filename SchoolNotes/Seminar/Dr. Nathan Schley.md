As a society, we are adept at constructing complex molecules from simple building blocks, but we struggle to make minor adjustments to complex molecules. Cetyl alcohol, a compound found in most commercially available face washes, is a prime example. Cetyl alcohol can be produced from the hydrocracking process used in petroleum refining. This method involves breaking down large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller ones with the addition of hydrogen gas under high pressure and high temperature. However, this process is not very efficient as it requires multiple steps, including distillation, to isolate cetyl alcohol. A more direct approach, such as inserting oxygen into a linear hydrocarbon, would be preferable, but it is currently not possible to selectively oxidize the terminal position of a linear aliphatic hydrocarbon using radical oxidation methods.


By plotting hydrocarbons by activation energy and complexity, we observe that major components of crude oil, such as paraffins, have lower complexity compared to terpenes, lignins, and other hydrocarbons obtained from biological systems, which have higher complexity. As oxidation increases, so does the complexity of synthesizing these molecules. While society excels at synthesizing molecules from simple building blocks, we struggle to modify complex molecules directly to obtain the desired functionality. To address the selectivity problem in chemical synthesis, there is a need for catalysts that are more selective and can directly affect transformations. The use of radical C-H oxidation in functionalizing materials has been limited by its unselective nature. However, oxidative addition can offer a solution. This reaction involves the insertion of a low oxidation state metal into a carbon-hydrogen bond, resulting in the formation of a new carbon-metal hydrogen bond. In some cases, oxidative addition can be highly selective, especially in the terminal position. Therefore, concerted C-H bond cleavage through oxidative addition can be a promising approach for achieving greater selectivity in chemical transformations.

J. Chatt and J.M Dason were pioneers in the field of C-H activation, and their work in the mid-1950s laid the foundation for the development of numerous catalysts capable of activating C-H bonds selectively. One of their key contributions was the discovery of metal-carbon intermediates that play a crucial role in C-H activation. The earliest examples of homogeneous sp3 or sp3 C-H activation were intramolecular cases, which were also discovered by Chatt and Dason. This reaction is also known for Sp2 C-H bonds. It would take more than a decade before people found intermolecular cases.

Robert Crabtree has made significant contributions to the field of intermolecular activation of hydrocarbons, which involves the use of transition metal complexes to activate typically unreactive hydrocarbons. Crabtree has developed several catalysts that can activate hydrocarbons in this way, paving the way for new avenues of chemical synthesis. One of the most significant contributions that Crabtree has made in this area is the development of the "Crabtree's catalyst", which is a rhodium-based complex that is capable of activating a wide range of hydrocarbons. Crabtree's first example of intermolecular C-H activation involved the use of a rhodium-based catalyst to activate the typically unreactive hydrocarbon methane. In 1983, Crabtree and his colleagues reported that the rhodium complex [Rh(COD)(CH3CN)2]BF4, where COD is 1,5-cyclooctadiene, could catalyze the reaction between methane and carbon monoxide to produce acetic acid and hydrogen gas.

In the 1980s, Robert Bergman demonstrated the selectivity of the organometallic complex Cp*Ir towards terminal C-H activation. Bergman's studies involved the use of the organometallic complex Cp_Ir (where Cp_ is pentamethylcyclopentadienyl) to activate hydrocarbons, particularly alkynes. He found that the complex exhibited remarkable selectivity for the activation of terminal C-H bonds in alkynes, while leaving the internal C-H bonds intact. However, the use of Iridium, a rare and precious metal, made this reaction impractical to use at an industrial scale. Studies have revealed that the ligand choice for the catalyst is really important. His use of tert-butyl or phosphine ligands sterically hindered the iridium center, and caused intramelocular activation to complete with intermolecular activation. Later studies found that electron-donating ligands such as amine or phosphine ligands can increase the electron density of the iridium center, enhancing the reactivity and selectivity of the catalyst towards specific types of C-H bonds.

Dr. Nathan Schley's research in the past involved the development of iridium-catalyzed C-H borylation for the synthesis of alkylboronate esters from aliphatic hydrocarbons. Schley and his colleagues developed a highly selective and efficient iridium catalyst system for the borylation of unactivated aliphatic C-H bonds. The catalyst system consisted of an iridium precatalyst and a bulky N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) ligand, which promoted the selective activation of aliphatic C-H bonds and inhibited the unwanted isomerization and overborylation of the boronate esters. Using this catalyst system, Schley and his colleagues were able to selectively borylate a wide range of aliphatic hydrocarbons, including cycloalkanes, alkanes, and linear alcohols, to produce the corresponding alkylboronate esters in good yields and with high selectivity for the desired C-H activation product.
