Antibiotics have been one of the most significant medical discoveries of the 20th century, and they have saved millions of lives. However, the overuse and misuse of antibiotics have led to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria and has led to an increase in the number of infections that are difficult or impossible to treat. As of 2013, it was reported that over 57% of Staphylococcus aureus infections in US intensive care units were resistant to multiple antibiotics. In addition, there is emerging resistance to vancomycin, a drug that has often been considered the last line of defense against antibiotic-resistant infections. The World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the development of multi-drug resistance bacteria could lead to the deaths of up to 10 million people by 2050. The discovery and development of new antibiotics have slowed down significantly in recent years, due in part to the high cost and complexity of developing new drugs, as well as the challenges posed by antibiotic resistance.

Efforts are underway to address this problem, including the development of new types of antibiotics, such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a class of naturally occurring molecules that have potent antimicrobial activity against a broad range of microorganisms including fungi, viruses, and gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. One of the key advantages of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as potential alternatives to antibiotics is their reduced potential to induce bacterial resistance. Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) have a unique mechanism of action that involves disrupting the cell membrane of microorganisms, leading to rapid cell death. Unlike conventional antibiotics, which typically have a specific target within the bacterial cell, AMPs have a non-specific mode of action that can cause damage to multiple cellular components, including the cell wall, cytoplasmic membrane, and nucleic acids. This multi-hit action of AMPs can make it harder for bacteria to develop resistance, as multiple genetic mutations would be required to confer resistance to the different modes of action. In addition, the rapid killing of microorganisms by AMPs can limit the opportunities for the development of resistance, as the bacteria do not have sufficient time to adapt to the antimicrobial agent. There is also growing evidence to suggest that the combination of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) with conventional antibiotics can have synergistic effects that enhance their antimicrobial activity and decrease the selection of antibiotic-resistant bacteria.

Dr. Nsoki Phambu's research investigates the mechanism  of action of tryptophan-rich antimicrobial peptides. Although AMPs in general kill bacteria by disrupting the bacterial membranes, the mechanism of interaction is still open to debate. While it is generally accepted that antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) kill bacteria by disrupting the bacterial membranes, the precise mechanism of interaction between AMPs and bacterial membranes is still the subject of his ongoing research.

Dr. Nsoki Phambu's research is focused on investigating the mechanism of action of arginine- and tryptophan-rich antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). These AMPs are a class of antimicrobial peptides that contain high levels of arginine and tryptophan amino acids, which are thought to contribute to their antimicrobial activity. Several studies have used a combination of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and infrared (IR) spectroscopy to investigate the interaction between antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) and model membranes. These revealed that AMPs can induce conformational changes in the lipid molecules that make up the membrane, leading to alterations in the membrane structure and function. The exact nature of these changes can depend on the specific characteristics of the AMP, such as its charge and hydrophobicity, as well as the lipid composition of the membrane. In 2017, he worked with collaborators at a university in Austrailia where he investigated the use of tryptophan-rich AMPs as potential therapeutics for bacterial infections, including those caused by Staphylococcus and E. coli. The study found that the AMP was effective at killing both bacteria, with minimal toxicity to human cells.
